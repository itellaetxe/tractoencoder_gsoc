Repo to include my work of Google Summer of Code 2024, of the project: [AI/ML in Diffusion MRI processing](https://github.com/dipy/dipy/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2024#project-5-project-ideas-using-aiml-in-diffusion-mri-processing).

Project proposal link: [DIPY-Conditional Tractogram Generation Based on age and neurodegeneration using autoencoder networks](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/myprojects/details/BpY78ovV)

## How to install

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements with `uv`, which is way faster than  `pip`:
```bash
pip install uv
```
3. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements:
```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```
